**You need DRCFLCServer to use client**

# This application is designed to store .flac files on a server or another storage location.
Before launching the app, you must specify the IP address and port configured in DRCFLCServer. Additionally, make sure you have foobar2000 installed—once that’s done, the application is ready to use.
## The app supports command-line arguments. 
For example: DRCFCLClient list — currently, only the list argument is available. Running it will display the contents of your library stored on the server.
## Inside the application, you can also use the following commands:
i — navigate and select a file using the arrow keys.
lpush — launch foobar2000 and load your selected audio files into it.
rm — delete the files you’ve downloaded from the local cache directory.
Good luck!
